# Optimization of Medical Inventory
This project addresses the significant increase in bounce rate that was leading to patient dissatisfaction. To resolve this, data was collected from various research sources and underwent preprocessing using Python, SQL, and EDA techniques. After cleaning the data, analysis was performed with Power BI and Excel to identify strategies to reduce the bounce rate. The implemented solution resulted in a reduction of the bounce rate by at least 30% and an increase in revenue by at least 2 million INR. The technology stack used includes PostgreSQL for the database, Python for programming, with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy libraries, and Power BI and Excel for business intelligence.
